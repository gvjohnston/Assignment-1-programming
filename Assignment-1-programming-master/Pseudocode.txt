1. Input as single numbers (chars?) in a stack. (do for both inputs)
2. Test for the biggest number and assign that as the first (1st-2nd).
   Note if the arrays are switched so a "-" can be prepended to output.
3. Calculate difference and store answer in third stack.
4. Output the answer with a "-" if necessary.

1.1 Prompt for input and read first input.
1.2 If input is the terminal symbol then stop inputing.
1.3 If input is the retry symbol call current stack's deconstructor and start again
1.4 If input is a number push it to the stack. (head to tail)
1.5 Else return an error.

2.1 If 2nd number > 1st number then 2nd number - 1st number 
    and boolean switched is set true

3.1 Take last digit of number 1 and 2.
3.1.1 If the stack is empty the number is 0.
3.1.2 If both stacks are empty the calculation is finished
3.2 If first digit is greater than 2nd digit then the next 1st digit -1 and current first digit +10.
3.3 Take the difference and push to answer stack. (tail to head)

4.1 If switched is TRUE then cout "-"
4.2 If answer stack is NOT empty push the next element
4.3 Else end program
